Human Skeleton 3D Graph Data Analysis for the Assessment of Physio Exercises


This project is focused on analysing time-series data of 3d graphs representing human skeleton data.
The data is acquired from MS Kinnect for scoring the physio activities. 
The publicly available KIMORE dataset will be used in this case. 
It consists recordings of different rehabilitation exercises performed by 78 subjects. 
It includes RGB, depth videos, and skeleton joint positions data of five physical exercises, mainly targeting low back pain. 
There are also assigned set of features to each exercise, that can be analysed to compute a score performance. 
In addition, the results of a questionnaire filled by clinicians are provided. 
The idea is to develop time-series model using LSTM for automatic evaluation of the activities.
